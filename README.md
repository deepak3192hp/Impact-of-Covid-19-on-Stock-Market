# Impact-of-Covid-19-on-Stock-Market

INTRODUCTION

Stock market prediction using machine learning
One of the most prominent use cases of machine learning is “Fintech” (Financial
Technology for those who aren't buzz-word aficionados); a large subset of which is in
the stock market. Financial theorists, and data scientists for the better part of the last
50 years, have been employed to make sense of the marketplace in order to increase
return on investment. However, due to the multidimensional nature of the problem,
the scale of the system, and inherent variation with time, it has been an
overwhelmingly tough challenge for humans to solve, even with the assistance of
conventional data analytics tools.
The general research associated with the stock or share market is highly focusing on
neither buy nor sell but it fails to address the dimensionality and expectancy of a new
investor. The common trend towards the stock market among the society is that it is
highly risky for investment or not suitable for trade so most of the people are not even
interested.

OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY

To predict the effect of the pandemic on the stock market of top 6 countries and
to forecast the behavior of stock market. thereby applying the machine learning
algorithm on the stock market data and build the system to predict the, market
behavior during the COVID -19
To apply the data analytics tool and statistics on the stock market data to reach
a conclusion. The mixture of data analytics in the stock market prediction can
help in decision making for individual as well as the companies
To test the accuracy of the data driven project on the real-life scenarios and test
their outcomes which further able to leverage our knowledge in the field of the
data analytics and machine learning.
To study the kind of uncertainties in the market due to the lockdown and
shutdowns in many large parts of the world and understand their relations with
respect to each other.
To get the clear picture of the market sentiments prevailing in the market now a
days to analyze their effects their pros and cons to other economies


Ours research methodology includes the following aspects :

STAGE 1
(DATA COLLECTION)
Looking for the top performing
countries
Analyze their best performing
stock indices
Take the suitable one indices
Collect the historical data of the
index for past 3 months
STAGE 2
(DATA ANALYSIS)
Using the PYTHON LANGUAGE
Draw comparison between the death
rate and market
Research hypothesis:
 The effect of the COVID -19 is continue to shaken the economies for
next 3 months
 Countries of observations are in the same state as they are during our
prediction Government measures and other external stimulus to revive
the economy is not taken into the consideration
 The trend of stock market continue to repeat itself .
 The inconsistencies of the data is already taken care off but
uncertainties of future are ignored
